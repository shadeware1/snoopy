# Snoopy - Geolocation to IP & MAC Extraction Tool

**Snoopy** is a specialized tool for passive SIGINT (signals intelligence) collection, focused on geolocation to IP and MAC address extraction. It leverages metadata triangulation, Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, and simple IP-to-location methods to gather and analyze device information. This tool allows you to input geographic data (like a ZIP code, city, or coordinates) or device-related metadata (such as device type, browser, or hardware model) to identify and track devices within the specified area.

## What is Snoopy?

**Snoopy** enables the collection of real-time, location-based device information using advanced passive techniques. It uses a combination of metadata triangulation and SDR to identify devices without directly interacting with them, making it useful for surveillance and intelligence gathering. 

Here's how it works:
- **Geolocation to IP & MAC Extraction**: You can enter geographic data, such as a ZIP code, city, or even precise GPS coordinates. **Snoopy** will triangulate nearby IP and MAC addresses corresponding to those locations.
- **Metadata Triangulation**: Once IP addresses are identified, **Snoopy** collects and analyzes metadata associated with those addresses, such as the device type, browser, and hardware model.
- **SDR Technology**: **Snoopy** uses SDR to passively collect signals from devices in the area, allowing it to identify active devices by listening to their network signals. This provides a non-invasive method for data gathering.
  
The tool then uses a simple IP-to-location service to provide detailed information about the device's location and other relevant metadata, such as the device's model, operating system, or software.

## How It Works

### Key Functions

1. **Geolocation to IP Mapping**:
   - **Snoopy** takes geographic input (like a city, ZIP code, or coordinates) and identifies the relevant IP addresses in that area. This is done by using triangulation from known sources or SDR to capture signals in real-time.

2. **Device Metadata Collection**:
   - After obtaining the IPs, **Snoopy** fetches device metadata, including:
     - Device type (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.)
     - Browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
     - Hardware model (iPhone 12, MacBook, etc.)
   - This metadata helps identify specific devices in the region.

3. **Passive Collection with SDR**:
   - **Snoopy** uses Software Defined Radio (SDR) hardware to listen to electromagnetic signals emitted by nearby devices. This allows **Snoopy** to identify devices without sending any probing requests.
   - It passively collects data such as MAC addresses and IP addresses, triangulating their positions based on the signals received.

4. **IP-to-Location Mapping**:
   - Once an IP address is obtained, **Snoopy** uses a basic IP-to-location tool to map the address to a geographic location and gather device details.
   - The tool can also track the location of the device in real-time, if configured to listen in a specific area.

### Example Flow

1. **User Input**: The user provides a location, such as a ZIP code or GPS coordinates.
2. **Snoopy Collects Data**: Using SDR, **Snoopy** listens for nearby devices and extracts IP and MAC addresses from the electromagnetic signals.
3. **Metadata Extraction**: **Snoopy** matches the IP addresses to known devices, identifying device type, browser, and other metadata.
4. **Device Details**: The tool then uses an IP-to-location service to provide full details of the devices in that area.

## Hardware Requirements

To run **Snoopy**, you will need specialized hardware:
- **Software Defined Radio (SDR)**: This is essential for passive signal collection. The SDR hardware allows **Snoopy** to listen to network signals emitted by nearby devices without actively probing them.
- **Antenna**: A suitable antenna is needed to receive the signals from devices in the area. The type of antenna depends on the environment and range you're targeting.
- **Computer or Terminal**: A device to run the **Snoopy** tool from the command line. This can be a standard laptop or desktop that supports the SDR hardware.

Without the appropriate SDR hardware, **Snoopy** will not be able to passively collect device signals and function as intended.

## Conclusion

**Snoopy** is a unique tool for gathering device information through passive SIGINT collection, leveraging advanced technologies like SDR and metadata triangulation. It's perfect for intelligence gathering, geolocation tracking, and network analysis, but requires specific hardware to function.

## Disclaimer

**Snoopy** is intended for responsible and legal use only. Always ensure compliance with local laws and regulations regarding data collection and surveillance when using this tool.
